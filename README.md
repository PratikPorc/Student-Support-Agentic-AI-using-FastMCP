# üéì Student Support Agentic AI using FastMCP

This project is an AI-powered student support agent built using **FastMCP (Fast Modular Cognitive Processing)**. The goal is to assist students in navigating course content, answering academic queries, and automating routine support tasks using modular and agentic AI capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

- üîç Context-aware academic query answering
- üß† Modular agent-based architecture using Claude's FastMCP
- üìä Dynamic course data handling via JSON datasets
- üí¨ Prompt-optimized interactions with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
- ü§ñ Extensible pipeline for integrating new tools and workflows

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Claude FastMCP** for modular cognitive workflows
- **OpenAI GPT / ChatGPT** for natural language generation
- **Google Gemini** for enhanced research and academic support
- **Python 3.10+** as the core development language

## üìå Use Cases

- Answering student doubts on course topics
- Recommending resources based on query context
- Automating repetitive student queries
- Providing summaries and explanations of difficult topics

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

> This is a prototype, so the following steps assume a local development setup.


# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PratikPorc/Student-Support-Agentic-AI-using-FastMCP.git
cd Student-Support-Agentic-AI-using-FastMCP

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or use pyproject.toml with poetry/pdm

# Run the agent
python main.py

## üåê Future Improvements

* Web interface for student interaction
* Real-time chat integration
* Multi-language academic support
* Integration with LMS (e.g., Moodle, Google Classroom)
